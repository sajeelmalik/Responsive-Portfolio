Media queries allow for responsive templates for multiple screen sizes. Some relevant CSS media query implementations are below, adapted for potential mobile use:
```
@media screen and (max-width:640px) {
  
  #logo {
    width: 100%;
  }

  nav {
    margin-right: 20px;
  }
  
  footer{
      position: relative;
  }

  .work {
    float: none;
    margin: 10px;
    height: 450px;
    width: 450px;
    }
}

```
